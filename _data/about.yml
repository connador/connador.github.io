#  ## Lists

# Unordered

# + Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
# + Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
#   - Marker character change forces new list start:
#     * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
#     + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
#     - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
# + Very easy!

# Ordered

# 1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
# 2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
# 3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


# 1. You can use sequential numbers...
# 1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

# Start numbering with offset:

# 57. foo
# 1. bar
